JSTorrent (javascript torrent client)

provides "JSTorrentClient", which stores a list of torrent files in
the browser's localStorage. Torrent data is backed by the HTML5 filesystem API.

requires:
- FileSystem API (included in Chrome)
- WebSocket API (most browsers have this)
  - with ArrayBuffer binary frame support

While web browsers still cannot listen for incoming connections, they
are now perfectly capable of creating client socket connections to
other BitTorrent clients. Alpha versions of uTorrent support peer
connections that are initiated via a websocket handshake.

Trackers will need to support JSONP requests for javascript clients to
find peers.
