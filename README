JSTorrent (JavaScript torrent client)

(Also a Chrome OS Web app)

provides "JSTorrentClient", which stores a list of torrent files in a
local storage mechanism. The actual torrent data is backed by the
HTML5 filesystem API.

requires:
- FileSystem API (included in Chrome, other browsers still have no implementations!)
- Web Workers (for CPU intensive sha1 hashing in the background)
- WebSockets (most browsers have this)
  - with ArrayBuffer binary frame support (also most browsers have)


While web browsers still cannot listen for incoming connections, they
are now perfectly capable of creating websocket connections to other
BitTorrent clients. Alpha versions of uTorrent know how to talk
bittorrent over websocket frames (Thanks to Art -

Trackers will need to support CORS cross site requests. For now an
official proxy is available. There is also a proxy for UDP Trackers.

This project can also be loaded as a "packaged app" in Chrome Canary
(essentially, like an extension), and it will make use of the Chrome
networking APIs (basically, gives access to raw UDP/TCP sockets)
