JSTorrent (javascript torrent client)

http://jstorrent.com

provides "JSTorrentClient", which stores a list of torrent files in
the browser's localStorage. Torrent data is backed by the HTML5 filesystem API.

requires:
- FileSystem API (included in Chrome)
- WebSocket API (most browsers have this)
  - with ArrayBuffer binary frame support (also most browsers have)

While web browsers still cannot listen for incoming connections, they
are now perfectly capable of creating client socket connections to
other BitTorrent clients. Alpha versions of uTorrent support peer
connections that are initiated via a websocket handshake.

Trackers will need to support CORS cross site requests. 
For now official a proxy is available.
