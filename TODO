Fixes

- Websockets don't really send close notification. Need better detection that a connection is stale... if last packet in was say 60 seconds ago, the connection is likely bad. It seems to disconnect after about 5 minutes ok...

- adjust number of outbound requests based on history/bitrate. Always have at least 1 outbound request per connected peer.

- swarm object -- keeps track of all peers known on a swarm. stores in local storage. tracker info feeds into this.


TESTING

- write tests for file boundaries

- simulated torrent file

- small torrent with several files. variable chunk sizes.

SPEED/OPTIMIZATION

- sha1 hashing speed... perhaps hash as files come in rather than waiting for entire piece to be done.


UI

- "add torrent" view

- switch detail tabs

- displaying images/videos


IDEAS

- support incoming connections via single long lived connection
 

VIDEO

- download last few chunks of an mp4 and attempt to parse the metadata (html5 video player need last chunk typically)


ETC

- file priorities



Core Protocol

- implement PEX (peer exchange protocol)

- upnp (can't see a way to make this work -- no way to discover devices or configure them)

- fix althash handling (symlink althash to actual hash and handle downloading under actual hash)

Interface/Usability

- show progress on torrent creation

- create view for torrentcreate/upload session

- have view for javascript torrent client. show whether files are
  backed by drag and drop. allow re-initialization of torrents/files
  by dragging in. store torrent metadata in persistent storage.


Demo

- fix up ktorrent piece requesting (keep track of outbound bytes)

Tracker

- write simply proxying tracker so web client can connect to peers
