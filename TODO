Core Protocol

- implement PEX (peer exchange protocol)

- upnp (can't see a way to make this work -- no way to discover devices or configure them)

- fix althash handling (symlink althash to actual hash and handle downloading under actual hash)

  backed by drag and drop. allow re-initialization of torrents/files
  by dragging in. store torrent metadata in persistent storage.
